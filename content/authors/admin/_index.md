      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I obtained my Ph.D. in computer science at Nanyang Technological University, advised by Prof. [Tianwei Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/tianwei.zhang/) and Prof. [Yang Liu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/). I'm leading the AI research at [Quantstamp](https://quantstamp.com/) as an AI engineer and blockchain security auditor, and I'm a member of the [OpenAI Red Team](https://openai.com/blog/red-teaming-network). Some of the projects that I have participated in including [GPT-4o](https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-4o-system-card.pdf) and [Operator](https://cdn.openai.com/operator_system_card.pdf). 

My current research interests cover a wide ranges in cyber security domain, including system security, AI security, blockchain security, and security testing. I'm particularly interested in AI for Security (leveraging AI for security-related tasks) and AI Safety/Security.
