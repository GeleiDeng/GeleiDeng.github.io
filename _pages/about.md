I am a first-year PhD student at Nanyang Technological university, advised by [Prof. Zhang Tianwei](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/tianwei.zhang/) and [Prof. Liu Yang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/). I received my bachelor degree at Singapore University of Technology and Design, where I was fortunate enough to be advised by [Prof. Chen Jiajia](http://faculty.nuaa.edu.cn/CHENJIAJIA/zh_CN/index.htm). My current research interests cover a wide ranges in cyber security domain, including robotic system security, web security, fuzzing, cryptography and more.

Before PhD study, I was a penetration tester and cyber security researcher working for Singapore government agency. My main strength is on web security and webapp source code review. My penetration testing research are published at [my personal blog](https://victomteng1997.github.io), and here is my [htb profile](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/117283).
